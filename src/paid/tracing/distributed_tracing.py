def generate_tracing_token() -> int:
    """
    Generate a unique tracing token without setting it in the context.

    Use this when you want to generate a trace ID to store or pass to another
    process/service without immediately associating it with the current tracing context.
    The token can later be used with set_tracing_token() to link traces across
    different execution contexts.

    Returns:
        int: A unique OpenTelemetry trace ID.

    Notes:
        - This function only generates and returns the token; it does NOT set it in the context.
        - Use this when you need to store the token separately before setting it.

    Examples:
        Generate token to store for later use:

            from paid.tracing import generate_tracing_token, set_tracing_token

            # Process 1: Generate and store
            token = generate_tracing_token()
            save_to_database("task_123", token)

            # Process 2: Retrieve and use
            token = load_from_database("task_123")
            set_tracing_token(token)

            @paid_tracing(external_customer_id="cust_123", external_agent_id="agent_456")
            def process_task():
                # This trace is now linked to the same token
                pass
